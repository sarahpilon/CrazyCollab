  "description": "Our product is a web application that helps groups plan meetings based on overlapping availability in schedules. Individuals in a group, either remotely or locally, can input their available dates and times, adapting across timezones, and cross reference availability with other group members. From there, a group meeting/event can be scheduled and sent to google calendar for easier tracking and planning.",
