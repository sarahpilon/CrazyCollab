* Prompt Communication: Respond to group messages within 24hrs.  
*  Everyone must work to get assignments done on time, or agree to take penalty for late work

Team Commitment to Respecting Everyone’s Individual Differences

* Do not make people too uncomfortable if they are sending you a cue to stop  
* Decision Making Inclusion: All voices are heard in decision making.

Team Commitment to Upholding These Ground Rules

* Failure to uphold a rule more than 4 times will result in you getting considered for maybe getting kicked, and talking with the professor  
* Conflicts should be addressed within the team in a respectful and private manner. If the issue persist, involve the professor

## **Conflict Resolution Strategy**

**Initial Attempt:** Private discussion between concerned members involved in conflict.

**Secondary Attempt:** If the issue cannot be resolved, mediation with the team leader and members involved in the conflict.

**Tertiary Attempt:** If no improvement is shown, or if the issue affects the group's progress, the team leader will facilitate a respectful, structured discussion with the entire team. 

**Final Attempt:** A member who has received three warnings without showing improvement will have their case escalated to the instructor for resolution.

– Any conflict related discussions will be documented to ensure transparency and accountability.

**\*\*\* Our team is committed to creating a safe, respectful, and inclusive environment for all members. Harassment of any kind will not be tolerated.**

**Abstract:**

Our product is a web application that helps groups plan meetings based on overlapping availability in schedules. Individuals in a group, either remotely or locally, can input their available dates and times, adapting across timezones, and cross reference availability with other group members. From there, a group meeting/event can be scheduled and sent to google calendar for easier tracking and planning.

**Goal:**

The goal of this product is to make scheduling for teams easier and more transparent. Visualizing the scheduling process will allow teams to seamlessly find open times to meet.

**Current Practice**:

Students may approach setting a meeting time by comparing their varying school and work schedules, either verbally or via text messaging. This practice can make it difficult to visualize an open meeting time, as team members are stuck trying to decipher times from rough text. 

Our product is not the first of its kind, with similar sites such as When2meet providing similar features that we promise. However, although When2meet is also conveniently a web application, it is very outdated and features an unfriendly UI. Our implementation will be very user friendly with its visual nature and ability to connect to google calendar for external scheduling.

**Novelty:**

Our approach saves the users schedule, which means they won’t have to retype their schedule when dealing with doing different group projects. Our approach also allows users to follow an intuitive UI, as current approaches either have a hard to visualize UI or relies on memorizing multiple student’s/friends/coworkers schedules. 

**Effects:**

If our product works as intended, we believe many individuals can benefit from its ease of use and genuine helpfulness for planning group meetings. Students, co-workers, friends, and family can all utilize our product to plan their collective schedules.

**Technical Approach:** 

We plan to implement our product as a web application, making it easily accessible to anyone with an internet connection. Within our application, we will integrate an understandable and easy to navigate UI to allow a seamless experience for users on any device using frameworks such as Bootstrap and Tailwind.

**Risks:**

The time constraint we must work within is the greatest risk factor we face in the development of this project. With only 10 weeks to build our software, all the while interacting with new APIs and frameworks, we will have to ensure we adequately and efficiently block out our development timeline to help keep us on track and allow room for error and setbacks.

**Features:**

* Easy to Navigate UI  
* WCAG 2.2 compliant accessibility standards  
* Able to adapt to diff time zones   
* Suggested Meeting times   
* Connect with google calendar to set up meeting times automatically

**Stretch Goals:**

* User Login System (mongodb)  
* Database to hold user data and available times (mongodb)
