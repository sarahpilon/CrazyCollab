# Week 4 Progress Report
## Team Report
1. **This Week's Planned Goals:**  
    1. Finish making a PlantUML diagram of class architecture diagram by Wednesday
    2. Complete most of UI design in Figma, finish by end of week
    3. Pick a project architecture and layout most of the software design and structure, finish in 5 days
2. **Team Progress and Issues:**  
We have started focusing on the design of our software as we continue making descisions and plans around the architecture of our project before the implementation phase. Our designs on Figma have been initially layed out, and most of our software architecture and design is already figured out. Throughout our work this week, the team struggled to keep pace due to midterms in other classes. This setback has slighly hindered our goals and progress, but it will be made up in the following week. We kept regular communication about our contributions, which helped us stay caught up with each other and our workloads.
3. **Next Week's Planned Goals:**  
    1. Fully complete designs on Figma, finish in 3 days
    2. Setup proper documentation for users and developers, as well as revisiting living doc's structure and organization, finish in 5 days
    3. Begin skeleton code and commits to codebase to prepare for mid-term project presentation, finish in 5 days

    1. Decided on a client-server architecture for the software and worked out design specifications
    2. Continually adding little by little helps achieve weekly goals
    3. Past experience will be able to aid in design of the software
    4. Had less time to work on goals due to working hours and other projects. Additionally, the code base needs to be started soon or else the project will be behind schedule
