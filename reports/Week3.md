# Week 3 Progress Report
## Team Report
1. **This Week's Planned Goals:**  
There are no major goals planned for this week, this is the first week of development.
2. **Team Progress and Issues:**  
We have created our living document and started to flesh our details for our project including project requirements and uses cases. Our project pitch presentation we delivered highlighted the goals of the project and allowed us to gather feedback from others. Through this, we've discovered similar apps to the one we plan to develop. We will continute with our vision for our product with these similar apps in mind, ensuring we implement features and functionality that are both important to our design and key to making our product unique.

    1. Finish making a PlantUML diagram of class architecture diagram by Wednesday
    2. Complete most of UI design in Figma, finish by end of week
    3. Pick a project architecture and layout most of the software design and structure, finish in 5 days
