# Week 3 Progress Report
## Team Report
1. **This Week's Goals:**  
There are no major goals planned for this week besides continuing to structure and organize our project documents and repository.
2. **Team Progress and issues:**  
We have continued to add design details to our living doc, further fleshing out the scope and the development of the project. Our project pitch presentation we delivered highlighted the goals of the project and allowed us to gather feedback from others. Through this, we've discovered similar apps to the one we plan to develop. We will continute with our vision for our product with these similar apps in mind, ensuring we implement features and functionality that are both important to our design and key to making our product unique.
3. **Next Week's Goals:**  
  i. Finalized project requirements and use cases within fleshed-out living doc; estimate 2 days  
  ii. Assist in finishing Figma wireframe draft, finish 3 days     
  iii. Finish making a PlantUML diagram of class architecture diagram by Wednesday
