# Week 4 Progress Report
## Team Report
(Goals from last week)  
(What we did, what we learned, what worked, where did we have trouble) We have continued to flesh out the living doc with design choices, and we pitched our project as a presentation containing all the features and characteristics we desire for our final product.
